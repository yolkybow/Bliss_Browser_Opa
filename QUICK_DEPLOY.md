## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Database (SQLite) may be reset periodically

### For Production Use
Consider upgrading to paid plan ($7/month) for:
- No sleep time
- Persistent storage
- Better performance
- Custom domain support

---

## 🔒 Add Security (RECOMMENDED)

Since this contains financial data, add password protection!

### Option 1: Simple HTTP Auth

Add to `.env` on Render:
```
APP_USERNAME=your_username
APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

### Option 2: Use Cloudflare Access

Free and secure:
1. Add your domain to Cloudflare
2. Enable Cloudflare Access
3. Set up authentication

---

## 📱 Access From Anywhere

Once deployed, you can access your portfolio from:
- ✅ Desktop computer
- ✅ Laptop
- ✅ Phone browser
- ✅ Tablet
- ✅ Any device with internet

---

## 🔄 Update Your App

To deploy updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated feature"
git push
```

Render automatically redeploys on every push!

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed
- Check the build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Make sure `Procfile` exists

### App Won't Start
- Check application logs
- Verify `gunicorn` is in requirements.txt
- Check for syntax errors in `app.py`

### Database Not Persisting
- Free tier may reset database
- Upgrade to paid plan for persistence
- Or use external database (PostgreSQL)

3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
